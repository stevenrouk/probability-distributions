# Stats Distributions
Jupyter Notebook walkthroughs of statistical distributions and what they're good for.

**Statistical distributions are hard.** They can often seem arbitrary or incomprehensible, if you don't know what you're looking at. "What the heck is that formula?"

These Jupyter Notebook walkthroughs were designed to help explain where the most common statistical distributions come from, how to simulate them in Python code, and what kinds of problems they can be used to solve.

Like most everything in life, these are a work in progress!
